# python-api-challenge
# This challenge is focused on usage of APIs to retrieve information such as weather, city coordinates, hotel names within cities and more via python script. 
# This script also produces visualizations for Latitude and Temperature levels, Humidity, Cloudiness, Wind Speed etc. 
# There are two seperate Jupyter files, first one (WeahterPy) is focused mainly on analysis of Weather in different cities through OpenWeather API. Second file after retrieving list of cities produced in first Jupyter notebook, uses Geoapify API, to find nearby hotels within the radius of 10KM from the center of those cities.
